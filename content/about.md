> Unity, Progress, People

This site is a reflection of my thoughts and interests. It is mainly a collection of articles, notes, and recipes from my experiences and learnings. It is also a platform to share the ideologies of the progressive peoples originating from [ShanghaiTech](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/). 

The name of this site, "Union of Progressive Peoples", is borrowed from Ridley Scott's ["Alien" series](https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/), which I am a fan of. This name has two meanings. First, it represents my flavor of "Turning right on a left light" and does not necessarily reflect my political spectrum. Second, it pays my tribute to the progressive peoples and the valuable thoughts and ideas we developed together.
